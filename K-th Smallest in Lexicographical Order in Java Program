//What is Lexicographical :
"Lexicographical" refers to the ordering of words or strings based on the rules used in dictionaries. In this system, words are compared character by character from left to right,
with each character being evaluated based on its position in the alphabet. It is similar to alphabetical order but can also apply to sequences of other types of symbols.
